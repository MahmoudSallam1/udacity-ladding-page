## Description

Building dynamic and interactive landing page using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
The project focuses on building dynamic naviagation bar and adding active state to the section which currently on viewport.
To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Index
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the `id`, `class`, and `data-nav` variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.

## App
Here is where the functionality happens. First looping through each section to build dynamic navigation items for each section using section ID and data-nav attribute. Then, building a function to check if the current section is on the viewport and add an active state to it. Moreover, it adds an active state to the current item of the navigation bar as well. Then, making smooth scrolling after anchoring an item. Finally, testing the performance of the code before and after using performance.now().

 
## Styles
Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience.

## Running
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in the browser.
